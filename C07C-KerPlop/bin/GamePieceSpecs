The following is a matching of the requirements with each Game Piece that fulfills it:

At least 5 pieces that interact (i.e., extend GamePiece) [30pts].
	Include at least one for each type of InteractionResult: Ambrosia = Get Point, Boxer = Hit, Shinobi = Kill, Statue = None, 
																Nether Portal = Advance
	At least one piece should interact at a distance: Shinboi = can kill from 4 spaces away
	At most 3 can interact only when on the same square: Nether Portal and Ambrosia only interact when the player touches them.

At least 2 pieces that move (implement Moveable) [15pts].
	Use at least 2 different move algorithms: Shinobi = moves randomly, Boxer = follows player when the player is within six spaces
	At least 1 should include some type of random decision/motion: Shinobi = moves randomly

At least 1 piece should only be Drawable (i.e., not a GamePiece) [5pts]: Joker
